# Hospital_Resistome
In-hospital areas with distinct maintenance and staff-/patient traffic have specific microbiome profiles, functions, and resistomes

The following data are made public for the publication:

Data tables:

1) Amplicon:
- 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of Caporaso-approach -> output from biom: feature table, metadatafile and taxonomy file (after decontam and SRS normalization)
- all differential abundance test -> ANCOM, ANCOM2, ANCOM BC, aldex2, MaAsLin2 for Key taxa observation
  
2) Metagenomics:
- Abricate output -> for CARD, PlasFlow
- MEGAN taxonomy output: taxonomy feature table, metadatafile and taxonomy file (after SRS                 normalization)
- MEGAN function output -> function feature table, metadatafile and SEED functions (after SRS             normalization)
- MAGE -> EggNOG output, COG map, COG map selected functions metagenomes, COG relative abundance table and metadatafile 
- GRiD -> GRiD output file and metadata file
- MaAsLin -> statistical output
- good quality MAGs -> fasta files
